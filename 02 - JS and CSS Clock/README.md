# Day 2:

## Todo:

- [ ] `transform-origin` property
- [ ] transition
- [ ] Learn cubic bezier and `transition-timing-function` property?
- [ ] `block` element goes from left to right
- [ ] Info about setInterval(): The method will keep calling the specified function until clearInterval() method is called or the window is closed. The setInterval() method returns an ID which can be used by the clearInterval() method to stop the interval.

## Improvements

- [ ] Add digital lock
- [ ] Add animation when second/min/hour updates
